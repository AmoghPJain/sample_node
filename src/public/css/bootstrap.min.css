The file /github-actions-info-app/github-actions-info-app/src/public/css/bootstrap.min.css is intended to contain the minified CSS for Bootstrap 5. Since this is a large file and typically not manually created, you would usually download it from the official Bootstrap website or a CDN. However, for the purpose of this task, I will provide a placeholder comment indicating that this file is intentionally left blank.
